0         ! ireplt:    if 1, replot to gdat.txt, otherwise gdat1.txt, gdat2.txt, ...
1	  ! limit:     1 => Shape-Preservation Algorithm (SPA) used (should be zero!)
3	  ! itc        number of iterations for determining departure point
1	  ! kr:        ratio (kx/ky=kx/kz) of transverse to longitudinal length scales
1	  ! iso:       1 => isotropic advection field when kr = 1
0	  ! iquad      0 => comp on the full-period domain; otherwise on a quadrant of the full domain 
0.0d0	  ! pltstrt    beginning of time2pi range for plotting (requires ireplt=0)

1         ! irein      number of time steps between reinitialization application 
0         ! nordg      order of spatial differentiation for gradient magnitude (unstable for nordg=3)

0	  ! norda      order of spatial differentiation for gradient in advection scheme: 4 or 5 => WENO; otherwise 4rd-order upwind (faster); value of 0 recommended
0         ! lrunge     0 (1) => vel-ave collocation (runge-kutta integration) to get
